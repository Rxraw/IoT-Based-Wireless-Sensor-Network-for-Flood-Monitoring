# IoT-Based-Wireless-Sensor-Network-for-Flood-Monitoring
IoT-Based Wireless Sensor Network for Flood Monitoring is a wonderful technique to monitor water levels as they fill up in a certain environment. Using ESP32 and Arduino IDE, a strategic way to implement this is needed in such cases.



PREREQUISITS:

1 - IoT platform (eg..BLYNK,ThingSkeek,Amazon Web Services)
2 - Set up a notification system to recieve updates of the water level via email,SMS or others.



INSTRUCTIONS:

1 - Open up Arduino IDE
2 - Paste code from WaterFloodcode.txt
3 - Run and monitor from IoT platform of choice.
