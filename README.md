# IoT-Based-Wireless-Sensor-Network-for-Flood-Monitoring


IoT-Based Wireless Sensor Network for Flood Monitoring is a wonderful technique to monitor water levels as they fill up in a certain environment. Using ESP32 and Arduino IDE integrated with LoRa technology, a strategic way to implement this in teh eral world is needed in such cases.



## PREREQUISITS:

- IoT platform (eg..BLYNK,ThingSkeek,Amazon Web Services)
- Set up a notification system to recieve updates of the water level via email,SMS or others.



## INSTRUCTIONS:

- Open up Arduino IDE
- Paste code from WaterFloodCode.txt
- Run and monitor from IoT platform of choice.

## Tips when using BLYNK

- [Change ID,NAME and TOKEN to your actual BLYNK project]

- #define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID "ID"
- #define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME "Name"
- #define BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN "Token"
